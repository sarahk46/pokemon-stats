    <h1>The Pok&#233;dex Visualizer</h1>
    <div class = "css-typing box1">
      <p>Looking for the tool to help you become the very best Pok&#233;mon trainer like no one ever was?
      </p>
      <p>How about to catch 'em all? Well, look no further than the Pok&#233;dex visualizer!</p>
      <br>
      <p> The Pok&#233;dex visualizer is much similar to your actual Pok&#233;dex,
          which is a digital encyclopedia that gives information about   </p>
      <p> all known Pok&#233;mon. Unlike the Pok&#233;dex, where entries include extraneous information, like the weight, footprint, and location, the Pok&#233;
dex visualizer shares instead the most relevant information for you to be truly the very best. This includes information about all generations of Pok√©mon of each type with their speed, attack, defense, and HP compared with each other.</p>

    <p> To select specific generations of Pok&#233;mon, select from the checkboxes.
    </p>

    <p>Then, to choose among the different Pok&#233;mon types, click the colors on the legend (shift-click to get multiple types!).
    </p>

    <p> And voila! You can see the Pok&#233;mon of interest and their speed, attack, defense, and HP on the plot below!
    </p>

    <p> You can also hover over the points to identify specific Pok&#233;mon and learn more about them.
